                    making web page dynamic.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="A">Advantages of using frame:
                    <br>
                    We can display multiple pages in a single window.
                    <br>
                    Frame provides an excellent tool to create dynamic layouts and efficient navigating systems.
                    <br>
                    Frame enable some contents of the page to remain static and other contents to keep on changing.
                    <br>
                    Frame enable us to create among other things a navigation bar that never moves, pages that load
                    faster, permanent
                    reserved space for the site's logo or banner.
                    <br>
                    Due to frame the downloading time is less because images and other static details need not be loaded
                    with each and every
                    page.
                    <br>
                    Html forms:
                    <br>
                    HTML Form is a document which stores information of a user on a web server using interactive
                    controls. An HTML form
                    contains different kind of information such as username, password, contact number, email id etc.
                    <br>
                    The elements used in an HTML form are check box, input box, radio buttons, submit buttons etc. Using
                    these elements the
                    information of an user is submitted on a web server.
                    <br>
                    The form tag is used to create an HTML form.
                    <br>
                    HTML forms are required if you want to collect some data from of the site visitor.

                    <br>
                    For example: If a user want to purchase some items on internet, he/she must fill the form such as
                    shipping address and
                    credit/debit card details so that item can be sent to the given address.

                <p class="Q">Q2. What is difference between Session and Cookies?</p>
                <p class="A"><br> Cookies and Sessions are used to store information. Cookies are only stored on the
                    client-side machine, while sessions
                    get stored on the client as well as a server.
                    <br>

                    <u>Session</u>
                    <br>
                    A session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables
                    and their values are
                    stored. This data will be available to all pages on the site during that visit.
                    <br>
                    A session ends when the user closes the browser or after leaving the site, the server will terminate
                    the session after a
                    predetermined period of time, commonly 30 minutes duration.
                    <br>
                    <u>Cookies</u>
                    <br>
                    Cookies are text files stored on the client computer and they are kept of use tracking purpose.
                    Server script sends a
                    set of cookies to the browser. For example name, age, or identification number etc. The browser
                    stores this information
                    on a local machine for future use.
                    <br>
                    When next time browser sends any request to web server then it sends those cookies information to
                    the server and server
                    uses that information to identify the user.

                    disadvantages.</p>
                <p class="A"><br>
                    <u>XML Parsers</u>
                    <br>
                    An XML parser is a software library or package that provides interfaces for client applications to
                    work with an XML
                    document. The XML Parser is designed to read the XML and create a way for programs to use XML.
                    <br>
                    XML parser validates the document and check that the document is well formatted.
                    <br>
                    Let's understand the working of XML parser by the figure given below:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Types of XML Parsers
                    These are the two main types of XML Parsers:
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>

                        DOM
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SAX

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <u>DOM (Document Object Model)</u>
                <br>
                A DOM document is an object which contains all the information of an XML document. It is composed like a
                tree structure.
                The DOM Parser implements a DOM API. This API is very simple to use.
                <br>
                Features of DOM Parser
                <br>
                A DOM Parser creates an internal structure in memory which is a DOM document object and the client
                applications get
                information of the original XML document by invoking methods on this document object.
                <br>
                DOM Parser has a tree based structure.
                <br>
                <u>Advantages</u>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>It supports both read and write operations and the API is very simple to use.</li>
                    <li>It is preferred when random access to widely separated parts of a document is required.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <u>Disadvantages</u>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is memory inefficient. (consumes more memory because the whole XML document needs to loaded
                        into memory).</li>
                    <li>It is comparatively slower than other parsers.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <u>SAX (Simple API for XML)</u>
                <br>







                A SAX Parser implements SAX API. This API is an event based API and less intuitive.
                <br>
                <u>Features of SAX Parser</u>
                <br>
                It does not create any internal structure.
                <br>
                Clients does not know what methods to call, they just overrides the methods of the API and place his own
                code inside
                method.
                <br>
                It is an event based parser, it works like an event handler in Java.
                <br>
                <u>Advantages</u>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is simple and memory efficient.</li>
                    <li>It is very fast and works for huge documents.</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <u>Disadvantages</u>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is event-based so its API is less intuitive.</li>
                    <li>Clients never know the full information because the data is broken into pieces.</li>
                </ol>

                    accessibility in the class,
                    package, subclasses and other packages.</p>

                <p class="A">
                    Java Access Specifiers (also known as Visibility Specifiers ) regulate access to classes, fields and
                    methods in
                    Java. <br>
                    These Specifiers determine whether a field or method in a class, can be used or invoked by another
                    method in
                    another class or sub-class. Access Specifiers can be used to restrict access. Access Specifiers are
                    an integral part of
                    object-oriented programming. <br>

                    Types Of Access Specifiers :
                    <br>

                    In java we have four Access Specifiers and they are listed below.
                    <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>public</li>
                    <li>private</li>
                    <li>protected</li>
                    <li>default(no specifier)</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                We look at these Access Specifiers in more detail.
